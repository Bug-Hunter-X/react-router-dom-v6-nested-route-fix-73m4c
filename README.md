This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router Dom v6: nested components not rendering despite correctly defined routes.  The bug.js file showcases the problem, while bugSolution.js offers a solution.  The issue arises from a mismatch between the expected route structure and the actual implementation, often due to incorrect path definitions or missing components. The solution involves careful review of route paths and component exports to ensure consistency and proper component rendering.
